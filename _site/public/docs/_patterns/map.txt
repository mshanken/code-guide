An image is used here because the interactive version has reached its API limit.

Maps use the Mapbox service. To create a map, log into Mapbox and use the following settings:

Settings
* Streets: Disabled
* Buildings: Disabled
* Areas: Disabled
* Water: #3e9bd0
* Land: #d5d5d5

Replace the image with the embed code, which should look something like this (MAPID being your map ID):
